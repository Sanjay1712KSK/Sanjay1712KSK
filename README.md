I am a dedicated 2nd-year B Tech student specialising in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur. My interests lie in software development, where I am continually inspired by the power and versatility of Linux. 
I am deeply committed to AI/ML, and my enthusiasm for programming goes beyond just writing codeâ€”I immerse myself in the process, striving to create innovative and effective solutions.

With a strong foundation in AI/ML and a relentless drive to explore new technologies, I am eager to contribute to impact projects and collaborate with like-minded professionals. 
I am continually seeking opportunities to learn, grow, and make a meaningful difference in the tech industry.
